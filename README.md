## Description
Semester project for my scripting class.
The required theme was a web portal with raitngs and reviews.

## Disclaimer
The structure present in this project was created with supervision of the lecturer and was not originally created by me.
A lot of the displayed data is pulled live from the requested subreddit, since I did not know of any ways to cache data. Frequent refreshing is highly discouraged.
As a misunderstanding from my part the articles are still purchasable, even if the project was supposed to be a review website.
To function correctly the *Cathegory* must be filled with at least one entry. This cannot be done from the front-end side. After that is done, everything is controlable from the front-end.

## Documentation
Every component of the program is implemented separately and is therefore easily changable. Even the entire business logic can be changed with a single line edit. Except for a password being hardcoded, the program is actually very secure. The logging system is fairly secure. All strings are parsed heavily and multiple times to avoid easy hacks.

## TO-DO
Add a Docker element to spread the sharability to the database.
Find the original doctumentation for this project and push it.
